# BH-Verify-Bot
Opensource account verifier built in python.
I don't have much experience with discord bots so this can probably be improved, feel free to add your own features and use this in your own servers.

## Usage

1) Download the bot.py and database.json files and put them in the same folder.
2) Open the bot.py file and modify the variables, instructions should be clear from inside the script but feel free to message me on discord if you need help. Hunter_#7750
3) Download the required dependancies, i.e. Python and Discord.py
4) Run the script, preferably on a server since you'll want the bot online 24/7

To change the embeds you can modify the embed_builder function at the bottom of the script, regardless of if you know any python or not this is pretty straight forward.

## Credits

Although credit is appreciated, you don't need to credit me for making this if used in your own servers. Just don't claim to have made it yourself.

<sup>"Database.json" AHHAHAHAHAHAH</sup>
