# BH-Verify-Bot
Opensource account verifier built in python.
I don't have much experience with discord bots so this can probably be improved, feel free to add your own features.

# Usage

1) Download the bot.py and database.json files and put them in the same folder.
2) Open the bot.py file and modify the variables, instructions should be clear from inside the script but feel free to message me on discord if you need help.
3) Download the required dependancies, i.e. Python and Discord.py
4) Run the script, preferably on a server since you'll want the bot online 24/7
